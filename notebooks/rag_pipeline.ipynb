The quality of these representations\\nis measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previ-\\nously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We\\nobserve large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it\\ntakes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words\\ndata set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\\nmachine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\\nor less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\\nany signiﬁcant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\\nWith progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\\ncomplex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\\nthe most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\\nnetwork based language models signiﬁcantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\\n1.1\\nGoals of the Paper\\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word\\nvectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary.

This has been observed earlier in the context\\nof inﬂectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\\nsimilar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to ﬁnd words that have similar\\nendings [13, 14].\\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\\nsyntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\\nformed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vec-\\ntor(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen [20].\\nIn this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model\\narchitectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test\\nset for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities1, and show that many such regularities\\ncan be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends\\non the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.\\n1.2\\nPrevious Work\\nRepresentation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [10, 26, 8]. A very popular model\\narchitecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [1], where a\\nfeedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to\\nlearn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been\\nfollowed by many others.\\nAnother interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [13, 14], where the word vectors are\\nﬁrst learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train\\nthe NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this\\nwork, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the ﬁrst step where the word vectors are\\nlearned using a simple model.\\nIt was later shown that the word vectors can be used to signiﬁcantly improve and simplify many\\nNLP applications [4, 5, 29]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different\\nmodel architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 29, 23, 19, 9], and some of the resulting word\\nvectors were made available for future research and comparison2. However, as far as we know, these\\narchitectures were signiﬁcantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed\\nin [13], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices\\nare used [23].\\n2\\nModel Architectures\\nMany different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,\\nincluding the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\\nIn this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was\\npreviously shown that they perform signiﬁcantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities\\namong words [20, 31]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\\nSimilar to [18], to compare different model architectures we deﬁne ﬁrst the computational complex-\\nity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next,\\nwe will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.\\n1The test set is available at www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/word-test.v1.txt\\n2http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/\\nhttp://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/\\nhttp://www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/\\nhttp://ai.stanford.edu/˜ehhuang/\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 2}, page_content='For all the following models, the training complexity is proportional to\\nO = E × T × Q,\\n(1)\\nwhere E is number of the training epochs, T is the number of the words in the training set and Q is\\ndeﬁned further for each model architecture. Common choice is E = 3 −50 and T up to one billion.\\nAll models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation [26].\\n2.1\\nFeedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)\\nThe probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [1]. It consists\\nof input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, N previous words are encoded\\nusing 1-of-V coding, where V is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a\\nprojection layer P that has dimensionality N × D, using a shared projection matrix. As only N\\ninputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation.\\nThe NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden\\nlayer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N = 10, the size of the\\nprojection layer (P) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size H is typically 500 to 1000\\nunits. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the\\nvocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionality V . Thus, the computational complexity\\nper each training example is\\nQ = N × D + N × D × H + H × V,\\n(2)\\nwhere the dominating term is H × V . However, several practical solutions were proposed for\\navoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax [25, 23, 18], or avoiding normalized\\nmodels completely by using models that are not normalized during training [4, 9]. With binary tree\\nrepresentations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down\\nto around log2(V ). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N × D × H.\\nIn our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary\\ntree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes\\nin neural net language models [16]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and\\nthis further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree\\nwould require log2(V ) outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires\\nonly about log2(Unigram perplexity(V )). For example when the vocabulary size is one million\\nwords, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for\\nneural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in the N ×D×H term, we will later propose\\narchitectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efﬁciency of the softmax\\nnormalization.\\n2.2\\nRecurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)\\nRecurrent neural network based language model has been proposed to overcome certain limitations\\nof the feedforward NNLM, such as the need to specify the context length (the order of the model N),\\nand because theoretically RNNs can efﬁciently represent more complex patterns than the shallow\\nneural networks [15, 2]. The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and\\noutput layer. What is special for this type of model is the recurrent matrix that connects hidden\\nlayer to itself, using time-delayed connections. This allows the recurrent model to form some kind\\nof short term memory, as information from the past can be represented by the hidden layer state that\\ngets updated based on the current input and the state of the hidden layer in the previous time step.\\nThe complexity per training example of the RNN model is\\nQ = H × H + H × V,\\n(3)\\nwhere the word representations D have the same dimensionality as the hidden layer H. Again, the\\nterm H × V can be efﬁciently reduced to H × log2(V ) by using hierarchical softmax. Most of the\\ncomplexity then comes from H × H.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 3}, page_content='2.3\\nParallel Training of Neural Networks\\nTo train models on huge data sets, we have implemented several models on top of a large-scale\\ndistributed framework called DistBelief [6], including the feedforward NNLM and the new models\\nproposed in this paper. The framework allows us to run multiple replicas of the same model in\\nparallel, and each replica synchronizes its gradient updates through a centralized server that keeps\\nall the parameters. For this parallel training, we use mini-batch asynchronous gradient descent with\\nan adaptive learning rate procedure called Adagrad [7]. Under this framework, it is common to use\\none hundred or more model replicas, each using many CPU cores at different machines in a data\\ncenter.\\n3\\nNew Log-linear Models\\nIn this section, we propose two new model architectures for learning distributed representations\\nof words that try to minimize computational complexity. The main observation from the previous\\nsection was that most of the complexity is caused by the non-linear hidden layer in the model. While\\nthis is what makes neural networks so attractive, we decided to explore simpler models that might\\nnot be able to represent the data as precisely as neural networks, but can possibly be trained on much\\nmore data efﬁciently.\\nThe new architectures directly follow those proposed in our earlier work [13, 14], where it was\\nfound that neural network language model can be successfully trained in two steps: ﬁrst, continuous\\nword vectors are learned using simple model, and then the N-gram NNLM is trained on top of these\\ndistributed representations of words. While there has been later substantial amount of work that\\nfocuses on learning word vectors, we consider the approach proposed in [13] to be the simplest one.\\nNote that related models have been proposed also much earlier [26, 8].\\n3.1\\nContinuous Bag-of-Words Model\\nThe ﬁrst proposed architecture is similar to the feedforward NNLM, where the non-linear hidden\\nlayer is removed and the projection layer is shared for all words (not just the projection matrix);\\nthus, all words get projected into the same position (their vectors are averaged). We call this archi-\\ntecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not inﬂuence the projection.\\nFurthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task\\nintroduced in the next section by building a log-linear classiﬁer with four future and four history\\nwords at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word.\\nTraining complexity is then\\nQ = N × D + D × log2(V ).\\n(4)\\nWe denote this model further as CBOW, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous\\ndistributed representation of the context. The model architecture is shown at Figure 1. Note that the\\nweight matrix between the input and the projection layer is shared for all word positions in the same\\nway as in the NNLM.\\n3.2\\nContinuous Skip-gram Model\\nThe second architecture is similar to CBOW, but instead of predicting the current word based on the\\ncontext, it tries to maximize classiﬁcation of a word based on another word in the same sentence.\\nMore precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classiﬁer with continuous\\nprojection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We\\nfound that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases\\nthe computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current\\nword than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those\\nwords in our training examples.\\nThe training complexity of this architecture is proportional to\\nQ = C × (D + D × log2(V )),\\n(5)\\nwhere C is the maximum distance of the words. Thus, if we choose C = 5, for each training word\\nwe will select randomly a number R in range < 1; C >, and then use R words from history and\\n4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 4}, page_content='w(t-2)\\nw(t+1)\\nw(t-1)\\nw(t+2)\\nw(t)\\nSUM\\n       INPUT         PROJECTION         OUTPUT\\nw(t)\\n          INPUT         PROJECTION      OUTPUT\\nw(t-2)\\nw(t-1)\\nw(t+1)\\nw(t+2)\\n                   CBOW                                                   Skip-gram\\nFigure 1: New model architectures.

This will require us to do R × 2\\nword classiﬁcations, with the current word as input, and each of the R + R words as output. In the\\nfollowing experiments, we use C = 10.\\n4\\nResults\\nTo compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table\\nshowing example words and their most similar words, and understand them intuitively. Although\\nit is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much\\nmore challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We\\nfollow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for\\nexample, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example\\nof another type of relationship can be word pairs big - biggest and small - smallest [20]. We further\\ndenote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: ”What is the\\nword that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?”\\nSomewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations\\nwith the vector representation of words. To ﬁnd a word that is similar to small in the same sense as\\nbiggest is similar to big, we can simply compute vector X = vector(”biggest”)−vector(”big”)+\\nvector(”small”). Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest to X measured by cosine\\ndistance, and use it as the answer to the question (we discard the input question words during this\\nsearch). When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to ﬁnd the correct answer (word\\nsmallest) using this method.\\nFinally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the\\nresulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as\\na city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors\\nwith such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such\\nas machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other\\nfuture applications yet to be invented.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 5}, page_content='Table 1: Examples of ﬁve types of semantic and nine types of syntactic questions in the Semantic-\\nSyntactic Word Relationship test set.\\nType of relationship\\nWord Pair 1\\nWord Pair 2\\nCommon capital city\\nAthens\\nGreece\\nOslo\\nNorway\\nAll capital cities\\nAstana\\nKazakhstan\\nHarare\\nZimbabwe\\nCurrency\\nAngola\\nkwanza\\nIran\\nrial\\nCity-in-state\\nChicago\\nIllinois\\nStockton\\nCalifornia\\nMan-Woman\\nbrother\\nsister\\ngrandson\\ngranddaughter\\nAdjective to adverb\\napparent\\napparently\\nrapid\\nrapidly\\nOpposite\\npossibly\\nimpossibly\\nethical\\nunethical\\nComparative\\ngreat\\ngreater\\ntough\\ntougher\\nSuperlative\\neasy\\neasiest\\nlucky\\nluckiest\\nPresent Participle\\nthink\\nthinking\\nread\\nreading\\nNationality adjective\\nSwitzerland\\nSwiss\\nCambodia\\nCambodian\\nPast tense\\nwalking\\nwalked\\nswimming\\nswam\\nPlural nouns\\nmouse\\nmice\\ndollar\\ndollars\\nPlural verbs\\nwork\\nworks\\nspeak\\nspeaks\\n4.1\\nTask Description\\nTo measure quality of the word vectors, we deﬁne a comprehensive test set that contains ﬁve types\\nof semantic questions, and nine types of syntactic questions. Two examples from each category are\\nshown in Table 1. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions\\nin each category were created in two steps: ﬁrst, a list of similar word pairs was created manually.\\nThen, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a\\nlist of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by\\npicking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus\\nmulti-word entities are not present (such as New York).\\nWe evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (se-\\nmantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the\\nvector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question;\\nsynonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100% accuracy is likely\\nto be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology.\\nHowever, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively\\ncorrelated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information\\nabout structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions.\\n4.2\\nMaximization of Accuracy\\nWe have used a Google News corpus for training the word vectors. This corpus contains about\\n6B tokens. We have restricted the vocabulary size to 1 million most frequent words. Clearly, we\\nare facing time constrained optimization problem, as it can be expected that both using more data\\nand higher dimensional word vectors will improve the accuracy. To estimate the best choice of\\nmodel architecture for obtaining as good as possible results quickly, we have ﬁrst evaluated models\\ntrained on subsets of the training data, with vocabulary restricted to the most frequent 30k words.\\nThe results using the CBOW architecture with different choice of word vector dimensionality and\\nincreasing amount of the training data are shown in Table 2.\\nIt can be seen that after some point, adding more dimensions or adding more training data provides\\ndiminishing improvements. So, we have to increase both vector dimensionality and the amount\\nof the training data together. While this observation might seem trivial, it must be noted that it is\\ncurrently popular to train word vectors on relatively large amounts of data, but with insufﬁcient size\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 6}, page_content='Table 2:\\nAccuracy on subset of the Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, using word\\nvectors from the CBOW architecture with limited vocabulary.

In the further experiments, we\\nuse full set of questions in the new Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, i.e. unrestricted to\\nthe 30k vocabulary. We also include results on a test set introduced in [20] that focuses on syntactic\\nsimilarity between words3.\\nThe training data consists of several LDC corpora and is described in detail in [18] (320M words,\\n82K vocabulary). We used these data to provide a comparison to a previously trained recurrent\\nneural network language model that took about 8 weeks to train on a single CPU. We trained a feed-\\nforward NNLM with the same number of 640 hidden units using the DistBelief parallel training [6],\\nusing a history of 8 previous words (thus, the NNLM has more parameters than the RNNLM, as the\\nprojection layer has size 640 × 8).\\nIn Table 3, it can be seen that the word vectors from the RNN (as used in [20]) perform well mostly\\non the syntactic questions. The NNLM vectors perform signiﬁcantly better than the RNN - this is\\nnot surprising, as the word vectors in the RNNLM are directly connected to a non-linear hidden\\nlayer. The CBOW architecture works better than the NNLM on the syntactic tasks, and about the\\nsame on the semantic one.

This task consists of 1040 sentences, where one\\nword is missing in each sentence and the goal is to select word that is the most coherent with the\\nrest of the sentence, given a list of ﬁve reasonable choices. Performance of several techniques has\\nbeen already reported on this set, including N-gram models, LSA-based model [32], log-bilinear\\nmodel [24] and a combination of recurrent neural networks that currently holds the state of the art\\nperformance of 55.4% accuracy on this benchmark [19].\\nWe have explored the performance of Skip-gram architecture on this task. First, we train the 640-\\ndimensional model on 50M words provided in [32]. Then, we compute score of each sentence in\\nthe test set by using the unknown word at the input, and predict all surrounding words in a sentence.\\nThe ﬁnal sentence score is then the sum of these individual predictions. Using the sentence scores,\\nwe choose the most likely sentence.\\nA short summary of some previous results together with the new results is presented in Table 7.\\nWhile the Skip-gram model itself does not perform on this task better than LSA similarity, the scores\\nfrom this model are complementary to scores obtained with RNNLMs, and a weighted combination\\nleads to a new state of the art result 58.9% accuracy (59.2% on the development part of the set and\\n58.7% on the test part of the set).\\n5\\nExamples of the Learned Relationships\\nTable 8 shows words that follow various relationships. We follow the approach described above: the\\nrelationship is deﬁned by subtracting two word vectors, and the result is added to another word. Thus\\nfor example, Paris - France + Italy = Rome.

We believe that word\\nvectors trained on even larger data sets with larger dimensionality will perform signiﬁcantly better,\\nand will enable the development of new innovative applications.

Clearly, there is still a lot of discoveries to be made using these techniques.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper we studied the quality of vector representations of words derived by various models on\\na collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks. We observed that it is possible to train high\\nquality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network\\nmodels (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it\\nis possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.\\nUsing the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram\\nmodels even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That\\nis several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.\\nAn interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the\\nprevious state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [11]. The publicly available RNN vectors were\\nused together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman’s rank correlation\\nover the previous best result [31]. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied\\nto many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [12] and paraphrase detection [28]. It can\\nbe expected that these applications can beneﬁt from the model architectures described in this paper.\\nOur ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension\\nof facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for veriﬁcation of correctness of existing facts. Results\\nfrom machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\\ninteresting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\\nour comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\\nestimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\\nbuilding block for future NLP applications.\\n10'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2013-09-10T00:03:46+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20130910000346Z', 'page': 10}, page_content='7\\nFollow-Up Work\\nAfter the initial version of this paper was written, we published single-machine multi-threaded C++\\ncode for computing the word vectors, using both the continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram archi-\\ntectures4.

Extensive metadata for this con-\\ntent is often not available. Search and interpretation of this\\nand other human-generated content, like text, is diﬃcult and\\nimportant. A variety of machine learning and deep learn-\\ning algorithms are being used to interpret and classify these\\ncomplex, real-world entities. Popular examples include the\\ntext representation known as word2vec [32], representations\\nof images by convolutional neural networks [39, 19], and im-\\nage descriptors for instance search [20]. Such representations\\nor embeddings are usually real-valued, high-dimensional vec-\\ntors of 50 to 1000+ dimensions. Many of these vector repre-\\nsentations can only eﬀectively be produced on GPU systems,\\n1https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\\nas the underlying processes either have high arithmetic com-\\nplexity and/or high data bandwidth demands [28], or cannot\\nbe eﬀectively partitioned without failing due to communi-\\ncation overhead or representation quality [38].\\nOnce pro-\\nduced, their manipulation is itself arithmetically intensive.\\nHowever, how to utilize GPU assets is not straightforward.\\nMore generally, how to exploit new heterogeneous architec-\\ntures is a key subject for the database community [9].\\nIn this context, searching by numerical similarity rather\\nthan via structured relations is more suitable. This could be\\nto ﬁnd the most similar content to a picture, or to ﬁnd the\\nvectors that have the highest response to a linear classiﬁer\\non all vectors of a collection.\\nOne of the most expensive operations to be performed on\\nlarge collections is to compute a k-NN graph. It is a directed\\ngraph where each vector of the database is a node and each\\nedge connects a node to its k nearest neighbors.\\nThis is\\nour ﬂagship application. Note, state of the art methods like\\nNN-Descent [15] have a large memory overhead on top of\\nthe dataset itself and cannot readily scale to the billion-sized\\ndatabases we consider.\\nSuch applications must deal with the curse of dimension-\\nality [46], rendering both exhaustive search or exact index-\\ning for non-exhaustive search impractical on billion-scale\\ndatabases.\\nThis is why there is a large body of work on\\napproximate search and/or graph construction. To handle\\nhuge datasets that do not ﬁt in RAM, several approaches\\nemploy an internal compressed representation of the vec-\\ntors using an encoding.\\nThis is especially convenient for\\nmemory-limited devices like GPUs. It turns out that accept-\\ning a minimal accuracy loss results in orders of magnitude\\nof compression [21]. The most popular vector compression\\nmethods can be classiﬁed into either binary codes [18, 22],\\nor quantization methods [25, 37]. Both have the desirable\\nproperty that searching neighbors does not require recon-\\nstructing the vectors.\\nOur paper focuses on methods based on product quanti-\\nzation (PQ) codes, as these were shown to be more eﬀective\\nthan binary codes [34]. In addition, binary codes incur im-\\nportant overheads for non-exhaustive search methods [35].\\nSeveral improvements were proposed after the original prod-\\nuct quantization proposal known as IVFADC [25]; most are\\ndiﬃcult to implement eﬃciently on GPU. For instance, the\\ninverted multi-index [4], useful for high-speed/low-quality\\noperating points, depends on a complicated “multi-sequence”\\nalgorithm. The optimized product quantization or OPQ [17]\\nis a linear transformation on the input vectors that improves\\nthe accuracy of the product quantization; it can be applied\\n1\\narXiv:1702.08734v1  [cs.CV]  28 Feb 2017'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'page': 1}, page_content='as a pre-processing. The SIMD-optimized IVFADC imple-\\nmentation from [2] operates only with sub-optimal parame-\\nters (few coarse quantization centroids).

Finally, Section 6 provides extensive experiments for\\nour approach, compares it to the state of the art, and shows\\nconcrete use cases for image collections.\\n2.\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\nWe are concerned with similarity search in vector collec-\\ntions. Given the query vector x ∈Rd and the collection2\\n[yi]i=0:ℓ(yi ∈Rd), we search:\\nL = k-argmini=0:ℓ∥x −yi∥2,\\n(1)\\ni.e., we search the k nearest neighbors of x in terms of L2\\ndistance. The L2 distance is used most often, as it is op-\\ntimized by design when learning several embeddings (e.g.,\\n[20]), due to its attractive linear algebra properties.\\nThe lowest distances are collected by k-selection. For an\\narray [ai]i=0:ℓ, k-selection ﬁnds the k lowest valued elements\\n[asi]i=0:k, asi ≤asi+1, along with the indices [si]i=0:k, 0 ≤\\nsi < ℓ, of those elements from the input array. The ai will be\\n32-bit ﬂoating point values; the si are 32- or 64-bit integers.\\nOther comparators are sometimes desired; e.g., for cosine\\nsimilarity we search for highest values. The order between\\nequivalent keys asi = asj is not speciﬁed.\\nBatching.\\nTypically, searches are performed in batches\\nof nq query vectors [xj]j=0:nq (xj ∈Rd) in parallel, which\\nallows for more ﬂexibility when executing on multiple CPU\\nthreads or on GPU. Batching for k-selection entails selecting\\nnq × k elements and indices from nq separate arrays, where\\neach array is of a potentially diﬀerent length ℓi ≥k.\\n2To avoid clutter in 0-based indexing, we use the array no-\\ntation 0 : ℓto denote the range {0, ..., ℓ−1} inclusive.\\nExact search. The exact solution computes the full pair-\\nwise distance matrix D = [∥xj −yi∥2\\n2]j=0:nq,i=0:ℓ∈Rnq×ℓ.\\nIn practice, we use the decomposition\\n∥xj −yi∥2\\n2 = ∥xj∥2 + ∥yi∥2 −2⟨xj, yi⟩.\\n(2)\\nThe two ﬁrst terms can be precomputed in one pass over\\nthe matrices X and Y whose rows are the [xj] and [yi]. The\\nbottleneck is to evaluate ⟨xj, yi⟩, equivalent to the matrix\\nmultiplication XY ⊤. The k-nearest neighbors for each of\\nthe nq queries are k-selected along each row of D.\\nCompressed-domain search. From now on, we focus on\\napproximate nearest-neighbor search. We consider, in par-\\nticular, the IVFADC indexing structure [25]. The IVFADC\\nindex relies on two levels of quantization, and the database\\nvectors are encoded. The database vector y is approximated\\nas:\\ny ≈q(y) = q1(y) + q2(y −q1(y))\\n(3)\\nwhere q1 : Rd →C1 ⊂Rd and q2 : Rd →C2 ⊂Rd are quan-\\ntizers; i.e., functions that output an element from a ﬁnite\\nset. Since the sets are ﬁnite, q(y) is encoded as the index of\\nq1(y) and that of q2(y −q1(y)). The ﬁrst-level quantizer is a\\ncoarse quantizer and the second level ﬁne quantizer encodes\\nthe residual vector after the ﬁrst level.\\nThe Asymmetric Distance Computation (ADC) search\\nmethod returns an approximate result:\\nLADC = k-argmini=0:ℓ∥x −q(yi)∥2.\\n(4)\\nFor IVFADC the search is not exhaustive.\\nVectors for\\nwhich the distance is computed are pre-selected depending\\non the ﬁrst-level quantizer q1:\\nLIVF = τ-argminc∈C1∥x −c∥2.\\n(5)\\nThe multi-probe parameter τ is the number of coarse-level\\ncentroids we consider.\\nThe quantizer operates a nearest-\\nneighbor search with exact distances, in the set of reproduc-\\ntion values. Then, the IVFADC search computes\\nLIVFADC =\\nk-argmin\\ni=0:ℓs.t. q1(yi)∈LIVF\\n∥x −q(yi)∥2.\\n(6)\\nHence, IVFADC relies on the same distance estimations as\\nthe two-step quantization of ADC, but computes them only\\non a subset of vectors.\\nThe corresponding data structure, the inverted ﬁle, groups\\nthe vectors yi into |C1| inverted lists I1, ..., I|C1| with homo-\\ngeneous q1(yi). Therefore, the most memory-intensive op-\\neration is computing LIVFADC, and boils down to linearly\\nscanning τ inverted lists.\\nThe quantizers. The quantizers q1 and q2 have diﬀerent\\nproperties. q1 needs to have a relatively low number of repro-\\nduction values so that the number of inverted lists does not\\nexplode. We typically use |C1| ≈\\n√\\nℓ, trained via k-means.\\nFor q2, we can aﬀord to spend more memory for a more ex-\\ntensive representation. The ID of the vector (a 4- or 8-byte\\ninteger) is also stored in the inverted lists, so it makes no\\nsense to have shorter codes than that; i.e., log2 |C2| > 4 × 8.\\nProduct quantizer. We use a product quantizer [25] for q2,\\nwhich provides a large number of reproduction values with-\\nout increasing the processing cost.

We\\nthen focus on one of the less GPU-compliant parts involved\\nin similarity search, namely the k-selection, and discuss the\\nliterature and challenges.\\n3.1\\nArchitecture\\nGPU lanes and warps. The Nvidia GPU is a general-\\npurpose computer that executes instruction streams using\\na 32-wide vector of CUDA threads (the warp); individual\\nthreads in the warp are referred to as lanes, with a lane\\nID from 0 – 31. Despite the “thread” terminology, the best\\nanalogy to modern vectorized multicore CPUs is that each\\nwarp is a separate CPU hardware thread, as the warp shares\\nan instruction counter. Warp lanes taking diﬀerent execu-\\ntion paths results in warp divergence, reducing performance.\\nEach lane has up to 255 32-bit registers in a shared register\\nﬁle. The CPU analogy is that there are up to 255 vector\\nregisters of width 32, with warp lanes as SIMD vector lanes.\\nCollections of warps. A user-conﬁgurable collection of 1\\nto 32 warps comprises a block or a co-operative thread ar-\\nray (CTA). Each block has a high speed shared memory, up\\nto 48 KiB in size. Individual CUDA threads have a block-\\nrelative ID, called a thread id, which can be used to parti-\\ntion and assign work. Each block is run on a single core of\\nthe GPU called a streaming multiprocessor (SM). Each SM\\nhas functional units, including ALUs, memory load/store\\nunits, and various special instruction units. A GPU hides\\nexecution latencies by having many operations in ﬂight on\\nwarps across all SMs. Each individual warp lane instruction\\nthroughput is low and latency is high, but the aggregate\\narithmetic throughput of all SMs together is 5 – 10× higher\\nthan typical CPUs.\\nGrids and kernels. Blocks are organized in a grid of blocks\\nin a kernel. Each block is assigned a grid relative ID. The\\nkernel is the unit of work (instruction stream with argu-\\nments) scheduled by the host CPU for the GPU to execute.\\nAfter a block runs through to completion, new blocks can\\nbe scheduled. Blocks from diﬀerent kernels can run concur-\\nrently. Ordering between kernels is controllable via ordering\\nprimitives such as streams and events.\\nResources and occupancy. The number of blocks execut-\\ning concurrently depends upon shared memory and register\\nresources used by each block. Per-CUDA thread register us-\\nage is determined at compilation time, while shared memory\\nusage can be chosen at runtime. This usage aﬀects occu-\\npancy on the GPU. If a block demands all 48 KiB of shared\\nmemory for its private usage, or 128 registers per thread as\\nopposed to 32, then only 1 – 2 other blocks can run concur-\\nrently on the same SM, resulting in low occupancy. Under\\nhigh occupancy more blocks will be present across all SMs,\\nallowing more work to be in ﬂight at once.\\nMemory types. Diﬀerent blocks and kernels communicate\\nthrough global memory, typically 4 – 32 GB in size, with 5 –\\n10× higher bandwidth than CPU main memory.\\nShared\\nmemory is analogous to CPU L1 cache in terms of speed.\\nGPU register ﬁle memory is the highest bandwidth memory.\\nIn order to maintain the high number of instructions in ﬂight\\non a GPU, a vast register ﬁle is also required: 14 MB in the\\nlatest Pascal P100, in contrast with a few tens of KB on\\nCPU. A ratio of 250 : 6.25 : 1 for register to shared to global\\nmemory aggregate cross-sectional bandwidth is typical on\\nGPU, yielding 10 – 100s of TB/s for the register ﬁle [10].\\n3.2\\nGPU register ﬁle usage\\nStructured register data. Shared and register memory\\nusage involves eﬃciency tradeoﬀs; they lower occupancy but\\ncan increase overall performance by retaining a larger work-\\ning set in a faster memory. Making heavy use of register-\\nresident data at the expense of occupancy or instead of\\nshared memory is often proﬁtable [43].\\nAs the GPU register ﬁle is very large, storing structured\\ndata (not just temporary operands) is useful. A single lane\\ncan use its (scalar) registers to solve a local task, but with\\nlimited parallelism and storage.\\nInstead, lanes in a GPU\\nwarp can instead exchange register data using the warp shuf-\\nﬂe instruction, enabling warp-wide parallelism and storage.\\nLane-stride register array. A common pattern to achieve\\nthis is a lane-stride register array. That is, given elements\\n[ai]i=0:ℓ, each successive value is held in a register by neigh-\\nboring lanes. The array is stored in ℓ/32 registers per lane,\\nwith ℓa multiple of 32. Lane j stores {aj, a32+j, ..., aℓ−32+j},\\nwhile register r holds {a32r, a32r+1, ..., a32r+31}.\\nFor manipulating the [ai], the register in which ai is stored\\n(i.e., ⌊i/32⌋) and ℓmust be known at assembly time, while\\nthe lane (i.e., i mod 32) can be runtime knowledge. A wide\\nvariety of access patterns (shift, any-to-any) are provided;\\nwe use the butterﬂy permutation [29] extensively.\\n3.3\\nk-selection on CPU versus GPU\\nk-selection algorithms, often for arbitrarily large ℓand\\nk, can be translated to a GPU, including radix selection\\nand bucket selection [1], probabilistic selection [33], quick-\\nselect [14], and truncated sorts [40]. Their performance is\\ndominated by multiple passes over the input in global mem-\\nory. Sometimes for similarity search, the input distances are\\ncomputed on-the-ﬂy or stored only in small blocks, not in\\ntheir entirety. The full, explicit array might be too large to\\nﬁt into any memory, and its size could be unknown at the\\nstart of the processing, rendering algorithms that require\\nmultiple passes impractical. They suﬀer from other issues\\nas well.\\nQuickselect requires partitioning on a storage of\\nsize O(ℓ), a data-dependent memory movement. This can\\nresult in excessive memory transactions, or requiring parallel\\npreﬁx sums to determine write oﬀsets, with synchronization\\noverhead. Radix selection has no partitioning but multiple\\npasses are still required.\\nHeap parallelism. In similarity search applications, one\\nis usually interested only in a small number of results, k <\\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'page': 3}, page_content='1000 or so. In this regime, selection via max-heap is a typi-\\ncal choice on the CPU, but heaps do not expose much data\\nparallelism (due to serial tree update) and cannot saturate\\nSIMD execution units. The ad-heap [31] takes better advan-\\ntage of parallelism available in heterogeneous systems, but\\nstill attempts to partition serial and parallel work between\\nappropriate execution units.\\nDespite the serial nature of\\nheap update, for small k the CPU can maintain all of its\\nstate in the L1 cache with little eﬀort, and L1 cache latency\\nand bandwidth remains a limiting factor. Other similarity\\nsearch components, like PQ code manipulation, tend to have\\ngreater impact on CPU performance [2].\\nGPU heaps.\\nHeaps can be similarly implemented on a\\nGPU [7]. However, a straightforward GPU heap implemen-\\ntation suﬀers from high warp divergence and irregular, data-\\ndependent memory movement, since the path taken for each\\ninserted element depends upon other values in the heap.\\nGPU parallel priority queues [24] improve over the serial\\nheap update by allowing multiple concurrent updates, but\\nthey require a potential number of small sorts for each insert\\nand data-dependent memory movement. Moreover, it uses\\nmultiple synchronization barriers through kernel launches in\\ndiﬀerent streams, plus the additional latency of successive\\nkernel launches and coordination with the CPU host.\\nOther more novel GPU algorithms are available for small\\nk, namely the selection algorithm in the fgknn library [41].\\nThis is a complex algorithm that may suﬀer from too many\\nsynchronization points, greater kernel launch overhead, us-\\nage of slower memories, excessive use of hierarchy, partition-\\ning and buﬀering. However, we take inspiration from this\\nparticular algorithm through the use of parallel merges as\\nseen in their merge queue structure.\\n4.\\nFAST K-SELECTION ON THE GPU\\nFor any CPU or GPU algorithm, either memory or arith-\\nmetic throughput should be the limiting factor as per the\\nrooﬂine performance model [48]. For input from global mem-\\nory, k-selection cannot run faster than the time required to\\nscan the input once at peak memory bandwidth. We aim to\\nget as close to this limit as possible. Thus, we wish to per-\\nform a single pass over the input data (from global memory\\nor produced on-the-ﬂy, perhaps fused with a kernel that is\\ngenerating the data).\\nWe want to keep intermediate state in the fastest memory:\\nthe register ﬁle. The major disadvantage of register memory\\nis that the indexing into the register ﬁle must be known at\\nassembly time, which is a strong constraint on the algorithm.\\n4.1\\nIn-register sorting\\nWe use an in-register sorting primitive as a building block.\\nSorting networks are commonly used on SIMD architec-\\ntures [13], as they exploit vector parallelism. They are eas-\\nily implemented on the GPU, and we build sorting networks\\nwith lane-stride register arrays.\\nWe use a variant of Batcher’s bitonic sorting network [8],\\nwhich is a set of parallel merges on an array of size 2k. Each\\nmerge takes s arrays of length t (s and t a power of 2) to s/2\\narrays of length 2t, using log2(t) parallel steps. A bitonic\\nsort applies this merge recursively: to sort an array of length\\nℓ, merge ℓarrays of length 1 to ℓ/2 arrays of length 2, to ℓ/4\\narrays of length 4, successively to 1 sorted array of length ℓ,\\nleading to 1\\n2(log2(ℓ)2 + log2(ℓ)) parallel merge steps.\\nAlgorithm 1 Odd-size merging network\\nfunction merge-odd([Li]i=0:ℓL, [Ri]i=0:ℓR)\\nparallel for i ←0 : min(ℓL, ℓR) do\\n▷inverted 1st stage; inputs are already sorted\\ncompare-swap(LℓL−i−1, Ri)\\nend for\\nparallel do\\n▷If ℓL = ℓR and a power-of-2, these are equivalent\\nmerge-odd-continue([Li]i=0:ℓL, left)\\nmerge-odd-continue([Ri]i=0:ℓR, right)\\nend do\\nend function\\nfunction merge-odd-continue([xi]i=0:ℓ, p)\\nif ℓ> 1 then\\nh ←2⌈log2 ℓ⌉−1\\n▷largest power-of-2 < ℓ\\nparallel for i ←0 : ℓ−h do\\n▷Implemented with warp shuﬄe butterﬂy\\ncompare-swap(xi, xi+h)\\nend for\\nparallel do\\nif p = left then\\n▷left side recursion\\nmerge-odd-continue([xi]i=0:ℓ−h, left)\\nmerge-odd-continue([xi]i=ℓ−h:ℓ, right)\\nelse\\n▷right side recursion\\nmerge-odd-continue([xi]i=0:h, left)\\nmerge-odd-continue([xi]i=h:ℓ, right)\\nend if\\nend do\\nend if\\nend function\\nOdd-size merging and sorting networks.

It uses merge-\\nodd and sort-odd as primitives. Since the register ﬁle pro-\\nvides much more storage than shared memory, it supports\\nk ≤1024. Each warp is dedicated to k-selection to a single\\none of the n arrays [ai]. If n is large enough, a single warp\\nper each [ai] will result in full GPU occupancy. Large ℓper\\nwarp is handled by recursive decomposition, if ℓis known in\\nadvance.\\nOverview. Our approach (Algorithm 3 and Figure 2) oper-\\nates on values, with associated indices carried along (omit-\\nted from the description for simplicity). It selects the k least\\nvalues that come from global memory, or from intermediate\\nvalue registers if fused into another kernel providing the val-\\nues. Let [ai]i=0:ℓbe the sequence provided for selection.\\nThe elements (on the left of Figure 2) are processed in\\ngroups of 32, the warp size. Lane j is responsible for pro-\\ncessing {aj, a32+j, ...}; thus, if the elements come from global\\nmemory, the reads are contiguous and coalesced into a min-\\nimal number of memory transactions.\\nData structures.\\nEach lane j maintains a small queue\\nof t elements in registers, called the thread queues [T j\\ni ]i=0:t,\\nordered from largest to smallest (T j\\ni ≥T j\\ni+1). The choice of\\nt is made relative to k, see Section 4.3. The thread queue is\\na ﬁrst-level ﬁlter for new values coming in. If a new a32i+j\\nis greater than the largest key currently in the queue, T j\\n0 , it\\nis guaranteed that it won’t be in the k smallest ﬁnal results.\\nThe warp shares a lane-stride register array of k smallest\\nseen elements, [Wi]i=0:k, called the warp queue. It is ordered\\nfrom smallest to largest (Wi ≤Wi+1); if the requested k is\\nnot a multiple of 32, we round it up. This is a second level\\ndata structure that will be used to maintain all of the k\\nsmallest warp-wide seen values. The thread and warp queues\\nare initialized to maximum sentinel values, e.g., +∞.\\nUpdate. The three invariants maintained are:\\n• all per-lane T j\\n0 are not in the min-k\\n• all per-lane T j\\n0 are greater than all warp queue keys\\nWi\\n• all ai seen so far in the min-k are contained in either\\nsome lane’s thread queue ([T j\\ni ]i=0:t,j=0:32), or in the\\nwarp queue.\\nLane j receives a new a32i+j and attempts to insert it into\\nits thread queue. If a32i+j > T j\\n0 , then the new pair is by\\ndeﬁnition not in the k minimum, and can be rejected.\\nOtherwise, it is inserted into its proper sorted position\\nin the thread queue, thus ejecting the old T j\\n0 .\\nAll lanes\\ncomplete doing this with their new received pair and their\\nthread queue, but it is now possible that the second invariant\\nhave been violated.

N1 = ℓ/32,\\nand on random data drawn independently, N2 = O(k log(ℓ))\\nand N3 = O(k log(ℓ)/t), see the Appendix for a full deriva-\\ntion. Hence, the trade-oﬀis to balance a cost in N2C2 and\\none in N3C3. The practical choice for t given k and ℓwas\\nmade by experiment on a variety of k-NN data. For k ≤32,\\nwe use t = 2, k ≤128 uses t = 3, k ≤256 uses t = 4, and\\nk ≤1024 uses t = 8, all irrespective of ℓ.\\n5.\\nCOMPUTATION LAYOUT\\nThis section explains how IVFADC, one of the indexing\\nmethods originally built upon product quantization [25], is\\nimplemented eﬃciently. Details on distance computations\\nand articulation with k-selection are the key to understand-\\ning why this method can outperform more recent GPU-\\ncompliant approximate nearest neighbor strategies [47].\\n5.1\\nExact search\\nWe brieﬂy come back to the exhaustive search method,\\noften referred to as exact brute-force. It is interesting on its\\nown for exact nearest neighbor search in small datasets. It\\nis also a component of many indexes in the literature. In\\nour case, we use it for the IVFADC coarse quantizer q1.\\nAs stated in Section 2, the distance computation boils\\ndown to a matrix multiplication. We use optimized GEMM\\nroutines in the cuBLAS library to calculate the −2⟨xj, yi⟩\\nterm for L2 distance, resulting in a partial distance matrix\\nD′. To complete the distance calculation, we use a fused\\nk-selection kernel that adds the ∥yi∥2 term to each entry of\\nthe distance matrix and immediately submits the value to\\nk-selection in registers. The ∥xj∥2 term need not be taken\\ninto account before k-selection. Kernel fusion thus allows\\nfor only 2 passes (GEMM write, k-select read) over D′, com-\\npared to other implementations that may require 3 or more.\\nRow-wise k-selection is likely not fusable with a well-tuned\\nGEMM kernel, or would result in lower overall eﬃciency.\\nAs D′ does not ﬁt in GPU memory for realistic problem\\nsizes, the problem is tiled over the batch of queries, with\\ntq ≤nq queries being run in a single tile. Each of the ⌈nq/tq⌉\\ntiles are independent problems, but we run two in parallel\\non diﬀerent streams to better occupy the GPU, so the eﬀec-\\ntive memory requirement of D is O(2ℓtq). The computation\\ncan similarly be tiled over ℓ. For very large input coming\\nfrom the CPU, we support buﬀering with pinned memory\\nto overlap CPU to GPU copy with GPU compute.\\n5.2\\nIVFADC indexing\\nPQ lookup tables. At its core, the IVFADC requires com-\\nputing the distance from a vector to a set of product quanti-\\nzation reproduction values. By developing Equation (6) for\\na database vector y, we obtain:\\n∥x −q(y)∥2\\n2 = ∥x −q1(y) −q2(y −q1(y))∥2\\n2.\\n(7)\\nIf we decompose the residual vectors left after q1 as:\\ny −q1(y)\\n=\\n[ ey1 · · · eyb] and\\n(8)\\nx −q1(y)\\n=\\n[f\\nx1 · · · exb]\\n(9)\\nthen the distance is rewritten as:\\n∥x −q(y)∥2\\n2 = ∥f\\nx1 −q1( ey1)∥2\\n2 + ... + ∥exb −qb( eyb)∥2\\n2.\\n(10)\\nEach quantizer q1, ..., qb has 256 reproduction values, so\\nwhen x and q1(y) are known all distances can be precom-\\nputed and stored in tables T1, ..., Tb each of size 256 [25].\\nComputing the sum (10) consists of b look-ups and addi-\\ntions. Comparing the cost to compute n distances:\\n• Explicit computation: n × d mutiply-adds;\\n• With lookup tables: 256 × d multiply-adds and n × b\\nlookup-adds.\\nThis is the key to the eﬃciency of the product quantizer.\\nIn our GPU implementation, b is any multiple of 4 up to\\n64.

The inverted lists are stored as two\\nseparate arrays, for PQ codes and associated IDs. IDs are\\nresolved only if k-selection determines k-nearest member-\\nship. This lookup yields a few sparse memory reads in a\\nlarge array, thus the IDs can optionally be stored on CPU\\nfor tiny performance cost.\\nList scanning. A kernel is responsible for scanning the τ\\nclosest inverted lists for each query, and calculating the per-\\nvector pair distances using the lookup tables Ti. The Ti are\\nstored in shared memory: up to nq×τ ×maxi |Ii|×b lookups\\nare required for a query set (trillions of accesses in practice),\\nand are random access.\\nThis limits b to at most 48 (32-\\nbit ﬂoating point) or 96 (16-bit ﬂoating point) with current\\narchitectures. In case we do not use the decomposition of\\nEquation (11), the Ti are calculated by a separate kernel\\nbefore scanning.\\nMulti-pass kernels. Each nq × τ pairs of query against\\ninverted list can be processed independently.\\nAt one ex-\\ntreme, a block is dedicated to each of these, resulting in up\\nto nq × τ × maxi |Ii| partial results being written back to\\nglobal memory, which is then k-selected to nq × k ﬁnal re-\\nsults. This yields high parallelism but can exceed available\\nGPU global memory; as with exact search, we choose a tile\\nsize tq ≤nq to reduce memory consumption, bounding its\\ncomplexity by O(2tqτ maxi |Ii|) with multi-streaming.\\nA single warp could be dedicated to k-selection of each\\ntq set of lists, which could result in low parallelism.\\nWe\\nintroduce a two-pass k-selection, reducing tq × τ × maxi |Ii|\\nto tq × f × k partial results for some subdivision factor f.\\nThis is reduced again via k-selection to the ﬁnal tq×k results.\\nFused kernel. As with exact search, we experimented with\\na kernel that dedicates a single block to scanning all τ lists\\nfor a single query, with k-selection fused with distance com-\\nputation. This is possible as WarpSelect does not ﬁght for\\nthe shared memory resource which is severely limited. This\\nreduces global memory write-back, since almost all interme-\\ndiate results can be eliminated. However, unlike k-selection\\noverhead for exact computation, a signiﬁcant portion of the\\nruntime is the gather from the Ti in shared memory and lin-\\near scanning of the Ii from global memory; the write-back is\\nnot a dominant contributor. Timing for the fused kernel is\\nimproved by at most 15%, and for some problem sizes would\\nbe subject to lower parallelism and worse performance with-\\nout subsequent decomposition.

Unless stated other-\\nwise, experiments are carried out on a 2×2.8GHz Intel Xeon\\nE5-2680v2 with 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs on CUDA 8.0.\\n6.1\\nk-selection performance\\nWe compare against two other GPU small k-selection im-\\nplementations: the row-based Merge Queue with Buﬀered\\nSearch and Hierarchical Partition extracted from the fgknn\\nlibrary of Tang et al. [41] and Truncated Bitonic Sort (TBiS)\\nfrom Sismanis et al. [40]. Both were extracted from their re-\\nspective exact search libraries.\\nWe evaluate k-selection for k = 100 and 1000 of each row\\nfrom a row-major matrix nq × ℓof random 32-bit ﬂoating\\npoint values on a single Titan X. The batch size nq is ﬁxed\\nat 10000, and the array lengths ℓvary from 1000 to 128000.\\nInputs and outputs to the problem remain resident in GPU\\nmemory, with the output being of size nq × k, with corre-\\nsponding indices. Thus, the input problem sizes range from\\n40 MB (ℓ= 1000) to 5.12 GB (ℓ= 128k). TBiS requires large\\nauxiliary storage, and is limited to ℓ≤48000 in our tests.\\nFigure 3 shows our relative performance against TBiS and\\nfgknn. It also includes the peak possible performance given\\nby the memory bandwidth limit of the Titan X. The rela-\\ntive performance of WarpSelect over fgknn increases for\\nlarger k; even TBiS starts to outperform fgknn for larger ℓ\\nat k = 1000. We look especially at the largest ℓ= 128000.\\nWarpSelect is 1.62× faster at k = 100, 2.01× at k = 1000.\\nPerformance against peak possible drops oﬀfor all imple-\\nmentations at larger k. WarpSelect operates at 55% of\\npeak at k = 100 but only 16% of peak at k = 1000. This\\nis due to additional overhead assocated with bigger thread\\nqueues and merge/sort networks for large k.\\nDiﬀerences from fgknn. WarpSelect is inﬂuenced by\\nfgknn, but has several improvements: all state is maintained\\nin registers (no shared memory), no inter-warp synchroniza-\\ntion or buﬀering is used, no “hierarchical partition”, the k-\\nselection can be fused into other kernels, and it uses odd-size\\nnetworks for eﬃcient merging and sorting.\\n# centroids\\nmethod\\n# GPUs\\n256\\n4096\\nBIDMach [11]\\n1\\n320 s\\n735 s\\nOurs\\n1\\n140 s\\n316 s\\nOurs\\n4\\n84 s\\n100 s\\nTable 1:\\nMNIST8m k-means performance\\n6.2\\nk-means clustering\\nThe exact search method with k = 1 can be used by a k-\\nmeans clustering method in the assignment stage, to assign\\nnq training vectors to |C1| centroids.

We evaluate the trade-oﬀbetween\\nspeed, precision and memory on two datasets: 95 million\\nimages from the Yfcc100M dataset [42] and Deep1B. For\\nYfcc100M, we compute CNN descriptors as the one-before-\\nlast layer of a ResNet [23], reduced to d = 128 with PCA.\\nThe evaluation measures the trade-oﬀbetween:\\n• Speed: How much time it takes to build the IVFADC\\nindex from scratch and construct the whole k-NN graph\\n(k = 10) by searching nearest neighbors for all vectors\\nin the dataset. Thus, this is an end-to-end test that\\nincludes indexing as well as search time;\\n• Quality: We sample 10,000 images for which we com-\\npute the exact nearest neighbors. Our accuracy mea-\\nsure is the fraction of 10 found nearest neighbors that\\nare within the ground-truth 10 nearest neighbors.\\nFor Yfcc100M, we use a coarse quantizer (216 centroids),\\nand consider m = 16, 32 and 64 byte PQ encodings for each\\nvector. For Deep1B, we pre-process the vectors to d = 120\\nvia OPQ, use |C1| = 218 and consider m = 20, 40. For a\\ngiven encoding, we vary τ from 1 to 256, to obtain trade-\\noﬀs between eﬃciency and quality, as seen in Figure 5.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/vector_database.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-03-01T01:27:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20170301012702Z', 'page': 9}, page_content='Figure 6:\\nPath in the k-NN graph of 95 million images from YFCC100M. The ﬁrst and the last image are\\ngiven; the algorithm computes the smoothest path between them.\\nDiscussion. For Yfcc100M we used S = 1, R = 4. An\\naccuracy of more than 0.8 is obtained in 35 minutes. For\\nDeep1B, a lower-quality graph can be built in 6 hours,\\nwith higher quality in about half a day.\\nWe also experi-\\nmented with more GPUs by doubling the replica set, us-\\ning 8 Maxwell M40s (the M40 is roughly equivalent in per-\\nformance to the Titan X). Performance is improved sub-\\nlinearly (∼1.6× for m = 20, ∼1.7× for m = 40).\\nFor comparison, the largest k-NN graph construction we\\nare aware of used a dataset comprising 36.5 million 384-\\nd vectors, which took a cluster of 128 CPU servers 108.7\\nhours of compute [45], using NN-Descent [15]. Note that\\nNN-Descent could also build or reﬁne the k-NN graph for\\nthe datasets we consider, but it has a large memory over-\\nhead over the graph storage, which is already 80 GB for\\nDeep1B. Moreover it requires random access across all vec-\\ntors (384 GB for Deep1B).\\nThe largest GPU k-NN graph construction we found is a\\nbrute-force construction using exact search with GEMM, of\\na dataset of 20 million 15,000-d vectors, which took a cluster\\nof 32 Tesla C2050 GPUs 10 days [14]. Assuming computa-\\ntion scales with GEMM cost for the distance matrix, this\\napproach for Deep1B would take an impractical 200 days\\nof computation time on their cluster.\\n6.6\\nUsing the k-NN graph\\nWhen a k-NN graph has been constructed for an image\\ndataset, we can ﬁnd paths in the graph between any two\\nimages, provided there is a single connected component (this\\nis the case). For example, we can search the shortest path\\nbetween two images of ﬂowers, by propagating neighbors\\nfrom a starting image to a destination image. Denoting by\\nS and D the source and destination images, and dij the\\ndistance between nodes, we search the path P = {p1, ..., pn}\\nwith p1 = S and pn = D such that\\nmin\\nP\\nmax\\ni=1..n dpipi+1,\\n(12)\\ni.e., we want to favor smooth transitions. An example re-\\nsult is shown in Figure 6 from Yfcc100M4. It was ob-\\ntained after 20 seconds of propagation in a k-NN graph with\\nk = 15 neighbors. Since there are many ﬂower images in the\\ndataset, the transitions are smooth.\\n4The mapping from vectors to images is not available for\\nDeep1B\\n7.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe arithmetic throughput and memory bandwidth of\\nGPUs are well into the teraﬂops and hundreds of gigabytes\\nper second.\\nHowever, implementing algorithms that ap-\\nproach these performance levels is complex and counter-\\nintuitive. In this paper, we presented the algorithmic struc-\\nture of similarity search methods that achieves near-optimal\\nperformance on GPUs.\\nThis work enables applications that needed complex ap-\\nproximate algorithms before. For example, the approaches\\npresented here make it possible to do exact k-means cluster-\\ning or to compute the k-NN graph with simple brute-force\\napproaches in less time than a CPU (or a cluster of them)\\nwould take to do this approximately.\\nGPU hardware is now very common on scientiﬁc work-\\nstations, due to their popularity for machine learning algo-\\nrithms. We believe that our work further demonstrates their\\ninterest for database applications. Along with this work, we\\nare publishing a carefully engineered implementation of this\\npaper’s algorithms, so that these GPUs can now also be used\\nfor eﬃcient similarity search.\\n8.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] T.

Recall that t is the thread\\nqueue length.\\nWe call elements prior to or at position n\\nin the min-k seen so far the successive min-k (at n). The\\nlikelihood that an is in the successive min-k at n is:\\nα(n, k) :=\\n(\\n1\\nif n ≤k\\nk/n\\nif n > k\\n(13)\\nas each an, n > k has a k/n chance as all permutations are\\nequally likely, and all elements in the ﬁrst k qualify.\\nCounting the insertion sorts. In a given lane, an inser-\\ntion sort is triggered if the incoming value is in the successive\\nmin-k + t values, but the lane has “seen” only wc0 + (c−c0)\\nvalues, where c0 is the previous won warp ballot. The prob-\\nability of this happening is:\\nα(wc0 + (c −c0), k + t) ≈k + t\\nwc\\nfor c > k.\\n(14)\\nThe approximation considers that the thread queue has seen\\nall the wc values, not just those assigned to its lane. The\\nprobability of any lane triggering an insertion sort is then:\\n1 −\\n\\x12\\n1 −k + t\\nwc\\n\\x13w\\n≈k + t\\nc\\n.\\n(15)\\nHere the approximation is a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion.\\nSumming up the probabilities over c gives an expected num-\\nber of insertions of N2 ≈(k + t) log(c) = O(k log(ℓ/w)).\\nCounting full sorts. We seek N3 = π(ℓ, k, t, w), the ex-\\npected number of full sorts required for WarpSelect.\\nSingle lane. For now, we assume w = 1, so c = ℓ. Let\\nγ(ℓ, m, k) be the probability that in an sequence {a1, ..., aℓ},\\nexactly m of the elements as encountered by a sequential\\nscanner (w = 1) are in the successive min-k. Given m, there\\nare\\n\\x00 ℓ\\nm\\n\\x01\\nplaces where these successive min-k elements can\\noccur.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted.

For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2\\nMethods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y.

In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1\\nModels\\nRAG-Sequence Model\\nThe RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x, z) =\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN\\nY\\ni\\npθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model\\nIn the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN\\nY\\ni\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2\\nRetriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n\\x00d(z)⊤q(x)\\n\\x01\\nd(z) = BERTd(z), q(x) = BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3\\nGenerator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nx with the retrieved content z when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32].

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y | can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x, zi) ≈0 where y was not generated during beam\\nsearch from x, zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3\\nExperiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nk documents for each query. We consider k ∈{5, 10} for training and set k for test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43].

Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4\\nResults\\n4.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers\\neven when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such\\ncases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\\n4.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu\\npoints and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 6}, page_content='Document 1: his works are considered classics of American\\nliterature ...

RAG achieves an accuracy\\nwithin 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.\\nWe also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold\\nevidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5\\nAdditional Results\\nGeneration Diversity\\nSection 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations\\nA key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping\\nAn advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 7}, page_content='Table 4: Human assessments for the Jeopardy\\nQuestion Generation Task.\\nFactuality\\nSpeciﬁcity\\nBART better\\n7.1%\\n16.8%\\nRAG better\\n42.7%\\n37.4%\\nBoth good\\n11.7%\\n11.8%\\nBoth poor\\n17.7%\\n6.9%\\nNo majority\\n20.8%\\n20.1%\\nTable 5: Ratio of distinct to total tri-grams for\\ngeneration tasks.\\nMSMARCO\\nJeopardy QGen\\nGold\\n89.6%\\n90.0%\\nBART\\n70.7%\\n32.4%\\nRAG-Token\\n77.8%\\n46.8%\\nRAG-Seq.\\n83.5%\\n53.8%\\nTable 6: Ablations on the dev set.

Such tasks include open-domain question answering [5, 29],\\nfact checking [56], fact completion [48], long-form question answering [12], Wikipedia article\\ngeneration [36], dialogue [41, 65, 9, 13], translation [17], and language modeling [19, 27]. Our\\nwork uniﬁes previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single\\nretrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks.\\n8'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 8}, page_content='General-Purpose Architectures for NLP\\nPrior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP\\ntasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval\\nThere is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures\\nOur document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches\\nOur method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6\\nDiscussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 9}, page_content='Broader Impact\\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB.

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing\\nThe answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups\\nThe open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE\\nFurther Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF\\nNull Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if k documents\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k + 1 predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG\\nParameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'file_path': '../data/pdf_files/rag_for_nlp.pdf.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 18}, page_content='Table 7: Number of instances in the datasets used. *A hidden subset of this data is used for evaluation\\nTask\\nTrain\\nDevelopment\\nTest\\nNatural Questions\\n79169\\n8758\\n3611\\nTriviaQA\\n78786\\n8838\\n11314\\nWebQuestions\\n3418\\n362\\n2033\\nCuratedTrec\\n635\\n134\\n635\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\n97392\\n13714\\n26849\\nMS-MARCO\\n153726\\n12468\\n101093*\\nFEVER-3-way\\n145450\\n10000\\n10000\\nFEVER-2-way\\n96966\\n6666\\n6666\\nparameters.

If you absolutely need to find the one best match, you can do \\nthat at the expense of speed and performance with NN. But if you can tolerate a tiny \\ndrop in accuracy, ANN is almost always a better solution. \\n \\nHow approximate nearest neighbor algorithms work \\nThe first part of how ANN works is dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to turn a \\nhigher-dimensional data set into a lower-dimensional one. The aim is to make the \\npredictive model task less complicated and more efficient than having to analyze all the \\ndata. \\nThese algorithms rest on the mathematical concept of metric spaces — where data \\npoints reside and distances between them are defined. These distances must adhere to \\nspecific rules (non-negativity, identity, symmetry, triangle inequality), and common \\nfunctions like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity are used to calculate them.  \\nTo better understand this, imagine you’re on holiday searching for the villa you’ve \\nrented. Instead of checking every single building one-by-one (higher-dimensional), \\nyou’d use a map, which reduces the problem into two dimensions (lower-dimensional). \\n(This is a deliberately simplistic example. Dimensionality reduction is not the sole \\nmethod employed by ANN algorithms to improve efficiency.) \\nANN algorithms also leverage clever data structures called indexes to improve \\nefficiency. By pre-processing the data into these indexes, ANN can navigate the search \\nspace much quicker. Think of these as street signs, helping you find where you are on \\nthe map to reach your holiday villa quicker. \\n \\nWhen to use approximate nearest neighbor search \\nIn the fast-paced world of data science, efficiency reigns supreme. While finding the \\ntrue closest neighbor (exact nearest neighbor search) holds value, it often comes at a \\ncomputational cost, as we’ve already talked about. This is where ANN search shines, \\noffering a compelling trade-off: lightning speed with high, but not absolute, accuracy. \\nBut when exactly should you choose ANN over other search methods? \\nExact nearest neighbor might be slow, but it’s the best option when accuracy is your \\npriority or you’re using small data sets. k-nearest neighbors (kNN) sits between NN \\nand ANN by giving you faster results while maintaining high accuracy.
